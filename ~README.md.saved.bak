## Folder Structure
![folder structure](folder_structure.JPG)


Let's break down each component:

1.`dbt_project.yml`: This is the main configuration file for your dbt project.

`analyses/:` Contains SQL files for ad-hoc analyses that don't need to be materialized.

macros/: Stores reusable Jinja macros for your project.

models/: This is where most of your data transformation logic resides.

staging/: Contains models that clean and standardize raw data.
intermediate/: Houses models that combine and transform staged data.
marts/: Stores final, business-ready data models.
seeds/: Holds CSV files that can be loaded as tables in your data warehouse.

snapshots/: Contains configurations for slowly changing dimension (SCD) tables.

tests/: Stores custom data tests to ensure data quality.

To set up this structure, you can use the dbt init command, which creates a basic project structure. You can then customize it by adding the subdirectories within the models/ folder.
